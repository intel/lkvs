Verifying XTILEDATA state component by TMUL instructions
====================

- Description:  
Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX) is a new 64-bit programming  
paradigm consisting of two components: a set of 2-dimensional registers  
(tiles) representing sub-arrays from a larger 2-dimensional memory image,  
and an accelerator able to operate on tiles, the first implementation is  
called TMUL(tile matrix multiply unit).  
This test is for verifying XTILECFG and XTILEDATA state component by TMUL  
instructions. In the test, multi-task can be launched to execute AMX/TMUL  
calculation, the procedure of calculation maybe interrupted by different  
reasons for several times, such as yield, sleep, trap, signal and futex.  
When the task come back, the calculation will be moved on for getting result.  
It will be checked if the result is correct or not.

- How to build:  

    gcc 11.1 or above is required.  

    To compile,  
    $ make

    To clean,  
    $ make clean

- How to run:

    a. show command usage  
    $ ./tmul --help

    b. Break sub-thread which is doing TMUL TDPBF16PS calculation by yield  
    $ ./tmul -b 1 -t 10 -c 20 -i 0

    c. Break sub-thread which is doing TMUL TDPBSSD calculation by sleep  
    $ ./tmul -b 2 -t 10 -c 20 -i 1

    d. Break sub-thread which is doing TMUL TDPBSUD calculation by trap  
    $ ./tmul -b 3 -t 10 -c 20 -i 2

    e. Break sub-thread which is doing TMUL TDPBUSD calculation by signal  
    $ ./tmul -b 4 -t 1000 -c 1000 -i 3  
    Notes: Signal is generated by main thread and handled by sub thread,  
    so need to run multi cycles to ensure sub-thread is interrupted when  
    TMUL calculation is being done.

    f. Break sub-thread which is doing TMUL TDPBUUD calculation by futex  
    $ ./tmul -b 5 -t 10 -c 20 -i 4
