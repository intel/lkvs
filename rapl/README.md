# Release Notes for Running Average Power Limiting test cases

The RAPL cases are designed for intel_rapl driver on Intel速 Architecture-based platforms.
Considering Intel速 Server and Client platforms have different rapl domains.
So created two tests files to distinguish the cases running on different test units.

The prerequisites to run the RAPL cases:
- User needs turbostat, stress, perf tools

tests-client file collects the cases for Intel速 client platforms
You can run the cases one by one, e.g. command

```
./intel_rapl_test.sh -t check_sysfs
```
You also can run the cases together with runtests command, e.g.

```
cd ..
./runtests -f rapl/tests-client -o logfile
```

tests-server file collects the cases for Intel速 server platforms.

These are the basic cases for Intel_RAPL driver, If you have good idea to 
improve cstate cases, you are welcomed to send us the patches, thanks!
