# Linux Kernel Validation Suite

The Linux Kernel Validation Suite (LKVS) is a Linux Kernel test suite. It is a working project created by the Intel Core Linux Kernel Val Team.
The purpose is to improve the quality of Intel-contributed Linux Kernel code. Furthermore, it shows the customer how to use or validate the features.

More details please refer to following.

## Features

  * [AMX(Advanced Matrix Extensions)](amx/README.md)
  * [cet(Control flow Enhancement Technology)](cet/README.md)
  * [cstate](cstate/README.md)
  * [Intel_TH(Trace Hub)](th/README.md)
  * [Intel_PT](pt/README.md)
  * [UMIP(User-Mode Instruction Prevention)](umip/README.md)
  * [xsave](xsave/README.md)

# Compile from sources

## Compile the whole project

```
git clone https://github.com/intel/lkvs.git
cd lkvs
make
```
Note. Usually, it needs various dependencies if you're trying to compile the whole project locally.
Each sub-project should detail its particular way, if any. There are some known dependency issues.

### Known dependency issue locally
* Intel PT
Cases of Intel PT need a 3rd part library libipt.
```
export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true
git clone http://github.com/intel/libipt.git
cd libipt && cmake . && make install
```

* CET
Cases of CET need 32-bit architect support:
```
dpkg --add-architecture i386
dpkg --print-foreign-architectures
apt-get update
apt-get install gcc-11 make libelf1 gcc-multilib g++-multilib
```

Make the driver for cet_driver:
```
Install the devel and headers package for target kernel and boot up
with target kernel.
For CentOS and so on rpm package related OS:
rpm -ivh --force kernel-TARGET_VERSION.rpm
rpm -ivh --force kernel-devel-TARGET_VERSION.rpm
rpm -ivh --force kernel-headers-TARGET_VERSION.rpm

For Ubuntu and so on deb package related OS:
dpkg -i linux-xxx-image_TARGET_VERSION.deb
dpkg -i linux-xxx-headers_TARGET_VERSION.deb
dpkg -i linux-xxx-dev_TARGET_VERSION.deb
dpkg -i linux-xxx-tools_TARGET_VERSION.deb

Boot up with target kernel version.
cd cet_driver
make
```

## Alternativly compile the whole project with Docker
** This is the recommended way **
```
make docker_image
make docker_make
```
Note. If you're behind a proxy, please export the local env variable `https_proxy` before executing `make`
```
export https_proxy=https://proxy-domain:port
```
## Compile a single test case

```
cd lkvs/<test>
make
```

# Run tests

There're two ways to run the tests.

## Binary/Shell directly

Normally, there're one or more executable binaries or scirpts in a sub-project, once it is compiled successfully. The easiest way is to run them directly.

## Case runner

**runtests** is a straightforward test runner that can execute a single or a set of test cases and redirect the log.

There are 2 ways to pass test to **runtests**:
  1. `-c`: Pass test cmdline.
  2. `-f <component/tests*>`: the `tests*` file under each component folder records the detailed test cmd lines.

Output of tests can be saved in a file using `-o` option.

Examples:

```
$ ./runtests -f <cmdfile>
$ ./runtests -f <cmdfile> -o <logfile>
$ ./runtests -c <cmdline>
$ ./runtests -c <cmdline> -o <logfile>
```
