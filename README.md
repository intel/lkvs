# Linux Kernel Validation Suite

The Linux Kernel Validation Suite (LKVS) is a Linux Kernel test suite. It is a working project created by the Intel Core Linux Kernel Val Team. The purpose is to improve the quality of Intel-contributed Linux Kernel code. Furthermore, it shows the customer how to use or validate the features.

[BM(Bare Metal)](BM/README.md) involves testing on physical machines without any hypervisor or virtualization software.

[KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)](KVM/README.md) is a virtualization technology for Linux that allows running multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical host. It leverages the Linux kernel to provide virtualization capabilities, enabling efficient and secure isolation between VMs. KVM test cases involve testing various aspects of virtualization, including VM creation, management, and functionality.
