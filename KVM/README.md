[KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)](KVM/README.md) is a virtualization technology for Linux that allows running multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical host. It leverages the Linux kernel to provide virtualization capabilities, enabling efficient and secure isolation between VMs. KVM test cases involve testing various aspects of virtualization, including VM creation, management, and functionality.
